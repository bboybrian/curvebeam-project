# Classroom Attendance Tracker

https://curvebeam-project.vercel.app/<br></br>Deployed on Vercel (frontend) & Google Cloud (backend).
[Azure SQL, React, Express, Node] 

Premise: Students are being picked up by car; the school needs to track who has been picked up.

Use case:
User enters the car registration number, and associated students are shown. User then selects students to dismiss, and clicks "send".
These students are marked as dismissed, and are shown by strikethrough (eg <strike>Hector</strike>), after which they can no longer be selected.

There is a ***reset*** button, to mark all students as present. There is also an ***edit*** page to interact with the database (eg Add Student, Remove Student, Add Car to Student etc)
